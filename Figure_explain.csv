Fig1A,"<strong>Essentiality of query gene (gene effect scores)</strong> in selected cancer type(s) from two genome-wide CRISPR screens: Broad and Sanger DepMaps. A score more negative than -1 defines strong essentiality; i.e., gene knockout effectively inhibits cell viability."
Fig1B,"Pan-cancer distribution of gene effect scores for the query gene. A score more negative than -1 defines strong essentiality; i.e., gene knockout effectively inhibits cell viability."
Fig1C,<strong>Correlation coefficients in gene effect scores</strong> between query gene and any other genes in Broad and Sanger screens.
Fig1D,<strong>Correlation in gene effect scores</strong> between the query gene and any other genes. A strong positive correlation denotes similar inhibitory effects between two gene knockouts.
Fig1E,"Network of <strong>the top 10 correlated genes</strong> as sorted in Panel 1D. Color and width of edges represent the direction and magnitude of correlations, respectively."
Fig1F,Gene effect scores of query gene and the gene selected from Panel 1D. Each dot is a cell line of the selected cancer type(s).
Fig1G,Similarity in inhibitory effects between <strong>knocking out the query gene</strong> and <strong>drug treatments</strong> in selected cancer cell lines. Drug sensitivity data are derived from the PRISM (4686 drugs) and GDSC (397 drugs) screens.
Fig1H,Correlations in inhibitory effects between <strong>knocking out the query gene</strong> and <strong>a drug treatment</strong>. A strong positive correlation denotes similar inhibitory effect between the query gene and a drug.
Fig1I,"Network of <strong>the top 10 correlated drugs to the query gene</strong> as sorted in Panel 1H. Color and width of edges represent the direction and magnitude of correlations, respectively."
Fig1J,"Gene effect scores of query gene and the drug selected from Panel 1H. Each dot is a cell line of the selected cancer type(s). Drug sensitivity is represented by log-fold change (PRISM) or IC50 (GDSC), where a more negative value denotes stronger treatment response."
Fig2A,"<strong>Essentiality of query genes (gene effect scores)</strong> across all cancer types from two genome-wide CRISPR screens: Broad and Sanger DepMaps. This plot demonstrates the essentiality of the genes in cell viability and thus, the importance of identifying a compound that perturb them. A score more negative than -1 defines strong essentiality; i.e., gene knockout effectively inhibits cell viability."
Fig2B,"<strong>Top drugs that perturb the query genes</strong> at the specified direction. For each query gene, an average change in expression levels following drug treatment is summarized across cell lines, and a P-value is calculated to indicate the significance of such changes. An average change across query genes is shown in the <strong>Mean Perturbation Score</strong> column accompanied by significance inferred by two statistical tests."
Fig2C,"<strong>Permutation distribution </strong><strong style=""color:blue;"">(blue curve)</strong> used to calculate <strong>Permutation pVal</strong> in Panel 2B for the <strong>observed Mean Perturbation Score (black line)</strong>."
Fig3A,"<strong>Sensitivity to query drug (log-fold change or IC50)</strong> in selected cancer type(s) from two large-scale drug screens: PRISM (log-fold change, 4686 drugs) and GDSC (IC50, 397 drugs). A more negative score represents stronger response; i.e., drug treatment more effectively inhibits cell viability."
Fig3B,"Pan-cancer distribution of sensitivities to the query drug. A more negative score represents stronger response; i.e., drug treatment more effectively inhibits cell viability."
Fig3C,<strong>Correlation coefficients in drug sensitivities</strong> between query drug and any other drugs in the same screening dataset (PRISM or GDSC).
Fig3D,<strong>Correlation in drug sensitivities</strong> between the query drug and any other drugs in the same screening dataset. A strong positive correlation denotes similar inhibitory effects between two drugs.

Fig4D,"<strong>Top similar drugs</strong> identified from the 4686 compounds assayed by PRISM. Similarity is measured by <strong>Tanimoto similarity</strong>, where 1 denotes a perfect match and 0 means no overlap in biochemical features."
Fig4E,"t-SNE plot is generated to display 3-D representations of the 1047 biochemical features across all 4686 compounds assayed by PRISM (grey dots). The query compound (<font color=""red"">red dot</font>) is projected to the t-SNE plot by an average of the 3 most similar drugs (<font color=""green"">green crosses</font>). The drug selected from Panel 4D is shown in a <font color=""#CCCC00"">yellow diamond</font>."
